KORPORACIJE
Kola mozes vratiti na mjesto gdje si ga preuzeo, a ne moras, moguce je u drugu firmu. Nekim firmama je nebitno gdje im ostavis auto, niko nije vlasnik auta.
Obicno se tzv one-way fee placa dodatno.

FRANSIZE
Obicno oni vracaju automobil na svoju lokaciju. Oni ce radije kazniti tebe one-way fee, zato sto nisi vratio automobil, jer im je veliki trud da oni vracaju automobil (a moraju ga vratit jer nemaju beskonacno, plus auto ne smije provodit vrijeme van koristenja). Mogu i oni pravit neku razmjenu vozila sa drugim fransizama i to, ali rijetko.

U principu, moze se vozilo pokupit i ne vratit na isto mjesto, ali to nosi troskove za kupca.
Takodje, treba nam osoblje koje ce u slucaju ne povratka, da ode po vozilo.

ZA ONE KOJI ZELE ZNATI VISE:
It depends on the rental car company and whether the locations involved are corporate or franchised.

If both locations are corporate, the car will simply be put into the fleet at the receiving location and rented out as if it had always been there. All of the major rental brands now use a “floating fleet” model, meaning that no single location owns a given vehicle and all cars are part of a regional or national fleet, and cars are divvied up by location based on projected volume. If a high number of one-way rentals results in an imbalance between locations, the rental company may move cars using drivers or car-hauling trucks.

In extreme cases—usually seasonal moves between the Northeast (summer demand heavy) and Florida (winter demand heavy)—they may even run promotional specials incentivizing people to rent cars on one-way rentals at super cheap rates (as low as $3 per day). These “Florida Drive-In” and “Florida Drive-Out” specials are quite popular and do result in several thousand cars being moved into peak markets without the rental company having to pay to ship cars.

If one or both of the rental locations in question is a franchise, then usually the vehicle will make its way back to the original location quickly, either using a dedicated employee driver or a private car carrier. Some franchises may have agreements with other nearby franchises to temporarily lease or split revenue on “foreign fleet” vehicles, but such arrangements are not too common and are for very short terms only. (With most companies, individual franchises purchase their own cars, so losing one to another location equals losing an expensive income-producing asset.)

Corporate locations mostly charge one-way fees because they can—it’s a revenue-generation scheme. One-way fees aren’t really related to actual costs of moving vehicles—a car picked up from a location like Orlando (with 50,000 cars in the fleet) and dropped off somewhere like Miami will simply be absorbed into the Miami-based fleet and won’t even be missed. (And there’s a good chance someone else will be taking another car from Miami to Orlando at some point anyway, so things will eventually balance out.)

Franchises, on the other hand, do incur hard costs to bring vehicles back to the owning location, but the one-way fees often significantly exceed the hard costs to move vehicles, because there’s a punitive aspect to the fees: they actually would almost rather discourage you from renting one-way, because the logistical hassle of retrieving the car is a bit of a headache, not to mention the lost revenue while the car is out of the fleet. If they’re going to bother with all that, they at least want to make it worth their while.
